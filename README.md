# SummonerTome
 Spigot Minecraft plugin:
Portable vehicles in Minecraft (inspired by Trove)  

 Craft magic books to summon various vehicles.  
• <b>Cleanliness and simplicity</b>: no need to look for vehicles, minecarts and boats will not cause traffic jams.  
• <b>Immortality</b>: as long as the book is intact, your beloved horse will be alive as well.  
• <b>United tome</b> = all in one: a minecart on rails, a boat on ice and water, a pig or a strider by fishing rods, otherwise a horse.  

<b>Wiki</b>: TODO
